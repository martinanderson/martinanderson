üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @martinanderson and this is **my Code and Story**.

I am a **Full Stack Web Developer** with more then 20 years of experience. And the next 20 years I see myself continuing that journey in **Web3**, in the depths of the **Blockchain**. 

This is me, full disclosure:

- üëÄ I got interested in coding at the age of about 15y, when I got a Commodore64 PC from the flee market, a simple rig connected to a 90's curved-screen TV :)  Everything got started from a bunch of floppy disks, a Commodore-Basic programming textbooks and a few magazines that came with it, no Internet access back then. Coded myself (after 2 years in) a simple ASCII ping-pong game and a password protected diary :) and been hooked ever since. 

- **At 1999 I started coding web projects as a job and business**. From the first browser-wars, thru the Web1 and Web2 growth pains and mobile revolution, into today's mobile-first social online commerce experience. Have coded a fully functional Content Management System and a bulk Email Marketing Software from scratch (both PHP), in addition to more general everyday development tasks. I guess one of the biggest **recognition's about the quality** of my code has been a successful passing of the security audit ordered by my customer, an international insurance giant. I have also coded a **cross-platform "Windows-Linux-iOS-Android" app** from a ground up (Python+Kivy). My only regrets in life are not releasing my code to Open Source and building a community behind my creations.

- **My strengths** are **PHP, Python, JavaScript/ActiveScript, CSS, MySQL/Postgres/SQLite**, in that order. And of curse the basket of **CSS/JavaScript libraries and frameworks** and the hunger to never stop learning as technologies develop and grow. I enjoy working both on the **Backend and Frontend coding** (also in that order). Have experience with UX. And have completed working products from draft to release. 

- I also feel very comfortable with **Linux and Docker server management**. In the beginning of 2K ran my own small hosting company on FreeBSD, but these days simply use my skills to set up Linux VPS or Docker servers, prefferrably on Debian. I manage to get everything done and run reliably, plus add some code for automation. 

- üå± I‚Äôm currently actively studying **Blockchain and Web3** development ‚Äì dapps, smart contracts, blockchain interoperability, cryptography, all that good stuff. I have strong conviction about cryptos eventual mass adoption (and belive the future is multichain). In the not so distant future more and more blockchain code will find it's way to the retail hands, for regular business use, personal finance, gaming, entertainment, social media, immutable data storage and so on. Literally thousands of applications and services are already in development right now and billions is being invested into the infrastructure.  A fact that people are still unaware of. Most people still don't have any idea of what's coming. And I'm preparing to catch a ride on that train with great enthusiasm :) And based on my past experience, I definetly know I need (to be a part of) a team. To make a true impact.

The Future is Now :)

I'm looking for a Blockchain/Web3 project that might have a use for a developer like me. I have been developing on different tech since the birth of the modern Internet. I work hard and learn fast. I have well equipped home office for remote work and can take a deep dive into your project right now. Dive into your blockchain, study the tech and get to work. We are all early and the future is bright.

- üíûÔ∏è Please contact me if you think that I can be a useful team member on your project. 
- üì´ Best way to reach me is by e-mail martin@all-tec.ee 
     or Signal/Whatsapp +639663475966 or Twitter DM @MXploresCrypto 
     
Oh PS. My nationality is estoian, from Estonia in EU, the most wired country in the world according to Wired :) But that probably doesn't carry any importance in todays remote work enviroment. But for example Estonia has a national digital-ID already over a decade and everything digital comes very natural to us. I guess that might be somewhat important to know :) 

I'm exited. Let's do amazing things together in the blockchain!
Have a beautiful day.
