- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @martinanderson and this is my Code.
- üëÄ I have been interested in coding since the age of about 15y, when I wrote my first apps on Commodore64, a flee market rig connected to TV, in Commodore-Basic. A simple ping-pong game and a diary and ever since that I've been hooked. From there I have grown thru Visual Basic, Delphi and Pascal, writing some code for Windows apps, to become a Full Stack Web Developer of now more then 20 years.
-  I started coding web projects for a living at 1999. From the first browser-wars, thru the Web1 and Web2 growth pains and mobile revolution, into today's mobile-first social online experience. Have coded a fully functional CMS and E-mail marketing software from scratch, in addition to more general everyday development tasks. I guess one of the biggest recognition's about the quality of my code has been a successful passing of the security audit ordered by my customer, an international insurance company. I have also coded a cross-platform "Windows-Linux-iOS-Android" app from a ground up.  I have recently started to organize my code to release it all to Open Source step by step. Looking back I realize that I should have done that a long time ago. Too late to change the world, but better late then never :) 
- My strengths are PHP, Python, JavaScript/ActiveScript, CSS, MySQL/Postgres/SQLite, in that order and of curse the rainbow of CSS/JavaScript libraries and frameworks. A Full Stack developer, but personally enjoy more working on the Backend code. 
- In addition to coding I'm also not a stranger to Linux and Docker server management. LAMP setups for web hosting and mail servers mostly, in addition to regular desktop setups. In the beginning of 2K ran my own hosting service on FreeBSD, but these days simply use my skills to set up Linux VPS or Docker servers on Debian. On this front I'm not some hardcore whitehat, but manage to get everything done and run it reliably, plus add some code for automation.  
- Odoo (odoo.com) Community Edition has turned out to be my favorite platform for fast, cost-efective and extendable web and back-office setups due it's Open Source principals and Python core. Amazing product :) with full data integration between it's army of different specialized apps. Especially if you need to build a modern fully integrated web, back-office and point of sale setup for a small business, a restaurant or a store for example.  

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning blockchain and web3 development - decentralized applications, smart contracts, blockchain interoperability, cryptography, all that good stuff. I have reached to the conclusion and have strong conviction about what is going to happen with blockchain technology mass adoption and a third generation Internet applications in the coming years. In the not so distant future more and more blockchain code will find it's way to the retail hands and regular business use. Blockchain is the backbone of the third generation Internet infrastructure and is empowering users in so many ways, giving power back to the people :) Indisputable fact that is clear to anyone that takes the time to really examine and understand that technology.
