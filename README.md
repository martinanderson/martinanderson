- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @martinanderson and this is **my Code and Story**.
- - I am a **Full Stack Web Developer** with more then 20 years of experience. 
- - The next 20 years I see myself continuing my journey to Web3.
- üëÄ I got interested in coding at the age of about 15y, when I got a Commodore64 PC from the flee market, a simple rig connected to a 90's curved-screen TV :)  Everything got started from a bunch of floppy disks, a Commodore-Basic programming textbooks and a few magazines that came with it, no Internet access back then. Coded myself a simple ASCII ping-pong game and a password protected diary :) and been hooked ever since. 
- **I started coding web projects as a job and business at 1999**. From the first browser-wars, thru the Web1 and Web2 growth pains and mobile revolution, into today's mobile-first social online commerce experience. Have coded a fully functional Content Management System and a bulk Email Marketing Software from scratch, in addition to more general everyday development tasks. I guess one of the biggest **recognition's about the quality** of my code has been a successful passing of the security audit ordered by my customer, an international insurance giant. I have also coded a **cross-platform "Windows-Linux-iOS-Android" app** from a ground up.  Recently started to oganize my code to release it all as Open Source, step by step. Looking back I realized that I should have done that a long time ago. Too late to change the world :) with that now, but better late then never.
- **My strengths** are **PHP, Python, JavaScript/ActiveScript, CSS, MySQL/Postgres/SQLite**, in that order. And of curse the basket of **CSS/JavaScript libraries and frameworks** and the hunger to never stop learning as technologies develop and grow. I enjoy working both on the **Backend and Frontend coding** (also in that order), but trying to avoid designer tasks. 
- And I feel very comfortable with **Linux and Docker server management**. LAMP setups for web hosting and mail servers experience mostly. In the beginning of 2K ran my own small hosting service on FreeBSD, but these days simply use my skills to set up Linux VPS or Docker servers on Debian. On this front I'm not some hardcore whitehat, but I manage to get everything done and run reliably, plus add some code for automation.  

- üå± I‚Äôm currently actively studying **Blockchain and Web3** development ‚Äì decentralized applications (dApp‚Äôs), smart contracts, blockchain interoperability, cryptography, all that good stuff. I have strong conviction about it's eventual mass adoption. In the not so distant future more and more blockchain code will find it's way to the retail hands, for regular business use, personal finance, gaming, entertainment, social media, immutable data storage and so on. Literally thousands of applications and services are already in development Today and billions is being invested into infrastructure. Blockchain is the backbone of the 3rd Generation Internet Infrastructure and is empowering users in so many ways, giving the person back the control over he‚Äôs personal data, ownership and independence. Indisputable and clear to anyone who has really examined the technology. And I'm preparing to catch a ride on that train with great enthusiasm :)
