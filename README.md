# üëã Hello! I'm @martinanderson ‚Äî a **Full Stack Developer**

### I have been coding professionally for the last 20+ years, since 1999. That's when I started my own business offering Web Development and related services in Estonia (European Union). The most wired country in the world according to Wired and the birthplace of Skype, Wise etc :)

### I've been hands-on thru the births and growth of Web1 and Web2. The today's modern Internet. And right now I'm excited to witness it's continuous evolution to **Web3**. I simply see that as an opportunity for another wave of innovation and growth as a coder.

### Writing code for me is and always has been just awesome. It's a way to challenge yourself intellectually, a way to create. A way to build and contribute. And it's almost never boring :)

## This is me, a full disclosure:

- üëÄ I got interested in coding at the age of about 15y, when I got a Commodore64 PC from the flee market, a simple rig connected to a 90's curved-screen TV :)  Everything got started from a bunch of floppy disks, a Commodore-Basic programming textbooks and a few magazines that came with it, no Internet access back then. Coded myself (after 2 years in) a simple ASCII ping-pong game and a password protected diary :) and have been hooked ever since. 

- **At 1999 I started coding web projects as a job and business**. From the first browser-wars, thru the Web1 and Web2 growth pains and mobile revolution, into today's mobile-first social online commerce experience. I have developed a fully functional **Content Management System** (CMS) and a bulk **Email Marketing Software** from scratch (and built a business around them), in addition to numerous other more general development tasks. The code is here in the Github, check it out. 

- **My strengths** are **PHP, Python, JavaScript/ActiveScript, CSS, MySQL/Postgres/SQLite**, in that order. And of curse the basket of **CSS/JavaScript libraries and frameworks** and the hunger to never stop learning as technologies develop and grow. I enjoy working both on the **Backend and Frontend** (also in that order). Have experience with **UX**. And have completed working products from draft to release. 

- I also feel very comfortable with **Linux and Docker server management**. There was a time when I also offered hosting services for business users on FreeBSD, but these days simply use my skills to set up Linux VPS or Docker servers, preferably on Debian. I manage to get everything done and run reliably, plus add some code for automation. 

- I guess one of the biggest **recognition's about the quality** of my code has been a successful passing of the security audit ordered by one of my customers, an international insurance giant. My CMS was created as a fully functional cross-platform WYSIWYG click and shoot environment long before things like Wordpress even existed and web browsers were fighting over market dominance (the Browser Wars). Yes, I am kind of proud of that accomplishment :) Took me years to develop and accumulated to about a hundred thousand lines of PHP+JavaScript when finished. Yes, about a 100,000 lines of original code, typed in line by line.

- I have also coded a **cross-platform "Windows-Linux-iOS-Android" app** from a ground up (Python+Kivy). And of course have played around a lot with different code doing this and that on Windows and Linux desktops over the years.  

- My only regret in life is not releasing my code to Open Source and building a community and a team behind my creations, especially the CMS. That would probably have been awesome and not doing that truly is my single and a big regret in life. A mistake I'm not planning to repeat.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently actively studying **Web3** development ‚Äì dApps, smart contracts, blockchain, interoperability, cryptography, all that good stuff. I have strong conviction about it's eventual mass adoption. And I'm preparing to catch a ride on that train with great enthusiasm :) It will take years, but it's coming. 

## The Future is Now

Do you might have a use for a developer like me? :) I've been building on different tech since the birth of the modern Internet. **I work hard and learn fast.** I have a well equipped home office for remote work and can take a deep dive into your project at a moments notice. Just dive in and get to work. 

- üíûÔ∏è Please contact me if you think that I can be a useful member in your team. 
- üì´ Best way to reach me is by e-mail martin@all-tec.ee 

### I'm exited to hear from you. Let's do amazing things together!
### Have a beautiful day :)

Thinking out loud:
In the not so distant future more and more Web3 and blockchain code will find it's way to the retail hands, in the hands of business users, personal finance sector, gaming, entertainment, social media, data storage and so on. Literally thousands of applications and services are already in development right now and billions is being invested into the infrastructure. The evolution of our beloved Internet is happening as we speak. But it is also a fact that **most** people are still unaware of that. Most people still don't have any idea of what's coming... Exciting times, again :)
