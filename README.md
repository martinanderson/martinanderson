# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @martinanderson and this is **my Code + Story**

### I am a **Full Stack Web Developer** with more then 20 years of experience. I've been hands-on thru the births and growth of Web1 and Web2. The today's modern Internet. And right now I'm excited to witness it's continuous evolution to **Web3**, with a birth of new tech and opportunity to grow as a coder. Writing code for me is just awesome. It's a way to challenge yourself intellectually, a way to create, to build and contribute. And it's almost never boring :)

## This is me, a full disclosure:

- üëÄ I got interested in coding at the age of about 15y, when I got a Commodore64 PC from the flee market, a simple rig connected to a 90's curved-screen TV :)  Everything got started from a bunch of floppy disks, a Commodore-Basic programming textbooks and a few magazines that came with it, no Internet access back then. Coded myself (after 2 years in) a simple ASCII ping-pong game and a password protected diary :) and have been hooked ever since. 

- **At 1999 I started coding web projects as a job and business**. From the first browser-wars, thru the Web1 and Web2 growth pains and mobile revolution, into today's mobile-first social online commerce experience. I have completed a fully functional Content Management System and a bulk Email Marketing Software from scratch (both PHP based), in addition to more typical development tasks. The code is here in the Github, check it out. 

- **My strengths** are **PHP, Python, JavaScript/ActiveScript, CSS, MySQL/Postgres/SQLite**, in that order. And of curse the basket of **CSS/JavaScript libraries and frameworks** and the hunger to never stop learning as technologies develop and grow. I enjoy working both on the **Backend and Frontend coding** (also in that order). Have experience with UX. And have completed working products from draft to release. 

- I also feel very comfortable with **Linux and Docker server management**. In the beginning of 2K ran my own small hosting company on FreeBSD, but these days simply use my skills to set up Linux VPS or Docker servers, preferably on Debian. I manage to get everything done and run reliably, plus add some code for automation. 

- I guess one of the biggest **recognition's about the quality** of my code has been a successful passing of the security audit ordered by one of my customer, an international insurance giant. My CMS was a fully functional WYSIWYG click and shoot enviroment long before things like Wordpress even existed. Yes, I am kind of proud of that accomplisment :) Took me years to develop and accumulated to about a hundred thousand lines of PHP+JavaScript when finished.

- I have also coded a **cross-platform "Windows-Linux-iOS-Android" app** from a ground up (Python+Kivy). And of course have played around a lot with different code doing this and that on Windows and Linux desktops over the years.  

- My only regret in life is not releasing my code to Open Source and building a community behind my creations, especially the CMS. That would probably have been awesome and not doing that truly is my single regret in life.  

- üå± I‚Äôm currently actively studying **Blockchain and Web3** development ‚Äì dApps, smart contracts, blockchain interoperability, cryptography, all that good stuff. I have strong conviction about the eventual mass adoption of Web3 and Blockchain. And I'm preparing to catch a ride on that train with great enthusiasm :) And based on my past experience, I definitely know I need (to be a part of) a team. To make a true impact.

## The Future is Now :)

Maybe there is a Blockchain/Web3 project that might have a use for a developer like me? :) I have been developing on different tech since the birth of the modern Internet. **I work hard and learn fast.** I have a well equipped home office for remote work and can take a deep dive into your project at a moments notice. Dive into your blockchain, study the tech and get to work. We are all early and the future is bright.

- üíûÔ∏è Please contact me if you think that I can be a useful team member on your project.

Oh PS. My nationality is Estonian, from Estonia in EU, the most wired country in the world according to Wired :)

### I'm exited to hear from you. Let's do amazing things together!
## Have a beautiful day :)



Thinking out loud:
In the not so distant future more and more Web3 and blockchain code will find it's way to the retail hands, in the hands of business users, personal finance sector, gaming, entertainment, social media, data storage and so on. Literally thousands of applications and services are already in development right now and billions is being invested into the infrastructure. The evolution of our beloved Internet is happening as we speak. But it is also a fact that **most** people are still unaware of that. Most people still don't have any idea of what's coming... Exciting times :)
